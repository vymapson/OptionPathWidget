# OptionPathWidget
jQuery class example from previous employment. Does not run on its own. 
This widget is an interactive jQuery dialog dyna-tree with the intent of replacing multiple dropdown menus.

The goal of this widget was to save space on the page of a web browser, replacing multiple drop down menus
of nested heirarchy with a clickable "URL" type link, that would open a dyna-tree. This tree would show the
heirarchical nesting of all the options previously shown by the mutliple dropdowns.

The benefit of this tree implementation is that it saves 2D space on the page, and reduces the number of
user clicks required to make a selection.
